## Description

This project is titled, InventoryWiz. It focuses on the final consumers or household members. Inventory helps a household or a family member determine the food items they have in their pantry and know which food items they need to buy on their next store visit thereby assisting them to effectively and efficiently manage their supplies and food items.

InventoryWiz is a MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js) application that involves the creation of a shopping list that keeps an inventory of pantry items.


## Motivation for the Project

The project team members are well motivated to create an app that takes inventory management and shopping experience to a new level with the introduction of a state-of-the-art MERN technology which enhances userâ€™s experience, saves user's time, and saves user's cost.

## What Problem Does It Solve?

The team anticipates that the application will save users time and energy of writing a shopping list on a piece of paper. The InventoryWiz app provides real-time updates to the shopping list. It also provide users with a top-notch User Interface and User Experience.
